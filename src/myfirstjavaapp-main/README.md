# My First Java Continuous Assessment 1 (CA1)

## Author
**Dean Carroll**

## Project Overview
This project is a Java application designed to read customer data from a file, process it, and calculate discounts based on specific levels. It is my first CA1 project for the Diploma in Applied Software Development at CCT College Dublin.

## Features
- Reads customer data from a `customers.txt` file.
- Processes customer information, including Name, Amount, Discount Level, and Year.
- Calculates discounts based on predefined levels:
  - Level 1: 10% discount
  - Level 2: 15% discount
  - Level 3: 20% discount
- Displays detailed information for each customer, including the final amount after discounts.
- Handles any data formatting errors gracefully, notifying if data isn't correct.
- Simple and clear console output for easy review.

## File Structure
- **Main.java**: The entry point of the program, handles reading customer data and processing calculations.
- **CustomerReader.java**: A utility class responsible for reading the `customers.txt` file and extracting customer information.
- **Customerlist.java**: The main logic for displaying customer data and calculating discounts.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository from GitHub:
3. Place the `customers.txt` file in the correct directory. The current file path in the project is:
4. Open the project in NetBeans or any Java-compatible IDE.
5. Run the `Main.java` file to see customer information and discounts.

## Setup Instructions
- Make sure the `customers.txt` file has the following format for each line:
- Example data:

## Error Handling
- If data in `customers.txt` does not follow the required format, the program will notify you with an error message.
- Proper handling of non-numeric values for Amount, Discount Level, or Year to ensure data integrity.
